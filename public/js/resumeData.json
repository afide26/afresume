His web development journey started with Ruby on Rails, with a 6 month online course certified by Careerfoundry.com.",
    "bio2":"Whilst in the process of completing his web development course certificate, he volunteered and readily used his newly acquired skills in designing and developing the IT information website used by over 1200 IT team members at Woolworths. Through the years, he continuously updated the site, managed its contents and performance (using Google Analytics) until it was deployed, based on higher management's recommendations to the Adobe Experience Manager platform. This event also allowed him another opportunity to demonstrate his skills to update the design and core functionality of the site and experience web development within a team using agile methodology.",
    "bio3":  "Alan has been sought after by peers for coaching and advice in web development. He has been sought as a resource in various projects when the pool of developers have been scarce and has helped in UI debugging for AngularJS internal applications and most recently the development of online recognition cards for 3 Woolworths Groups banners, namely Woolworths Group, Woolworths Supermarkets and BigW.",
    "bio4":"At the moment, Alan is updating his skills in ReactJS Context, Hooks and Redux by doing sample projects showing advance usage of these concepts. He also has a regular schedule of revisiting previous courses in order to refresh his skills in other related technologies.",
    "bio5":"His goal is to become a Senior Front-End Developer in the near future and become a Full Stack Web Developer in 3 years time.",
